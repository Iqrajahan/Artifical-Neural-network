# Artifical-Neural-network
In this project we can explored the effect of adding more hidden layer in neural network. network capcity to learn complex patterns can improved by adding hidden layer. if the model is not overfitting, adding hidden layer cause reduction in MSE on testing dataset. Reduction in MSE can result in better performance.
Adding mmore hidden layer can increase MSE on test dataset. when model starts to learn noise in traing data as a true pattern this can cause increase in MSE on test dataset.
To run this project we have to you jupyter nitebook either through anaconda or Google colab.
